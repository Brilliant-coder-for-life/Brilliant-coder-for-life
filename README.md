- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "bug" to describe a flaw in a program originated from an incident involving a moth? In 1947, Grace Hopper, a computer scientist,
- found a moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, causing a malfunction. She removed the moth and taped it into the computer's logbook with the notation
- "First actual case of bug being found." Since then, "debugging" has been used to describe the process of fixing errors in code. AND Did you know that the World Wide Web was
- proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN? HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, was created by Berners-Lee along with his colleagues
- to help share documents easily among researchers. It was initially conceived as a simple markup language for creating linked documents, but it has since evolved into a powerful
- tool for building entire websites and web applications. So, every time you write HTML code, you're essentially participating in a tradition that dates back to the early days of
- the internet! THAT'S ALL FOLKS
